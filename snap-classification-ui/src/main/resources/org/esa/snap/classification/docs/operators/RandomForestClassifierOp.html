<p>Random Forest (RF) is a classification and regression tree technique
    invented by Breiman. A RF randomly and iteratively samples the data and variables to generate a large group, or
    forest, of classification and regression trees. The classification output from
    RF represents the statistical mode of many decision trees achieving a more
    robust model than a single classification tree produced by a single model run (Breiman). Regression output from
    RF represents the average of all the regression trees grown in parallel without
    pruning. Three useful properties of RF are internal error estimates, the
    ability to estimate variable importance, and the capacity to handle weak
    explanatory variables. The iterative nature of RF affords it a distinct
    advantage over the other methods as this effectively bootstraps (by feeding
    random subsets of training data) the data for more robust predictions. This
    helps in reducing correlation between trees. Random subsets of predictor
    variables allow derivations of variable importance measures and prevent problems
    associated with correlated variables and over fitting (Breiman).</p>

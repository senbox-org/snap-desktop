		<h1>Product Library Tool</h1>
		
		<p>
			The Product Library Tool allows the user to search for products on a certain repository using specific filters to retrieve the product list. 
			Each repository has its own filters and some of them are mandatory.
		</p>

		<p>
			The products may be searched in terms of mission, satellite, product type and acquisition date. They may also be searched by graphically drawing an area of interest on the world map.
		</p>

		<img alt="product-library" src="images/product-library.png">

		<span>
			<br/><br/>There are two repository types:
		</span>
		<ul>
			<li>remote repository</li>
			<li>local repository</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Remote repository</h4>

		<p>
			In order to access the products stored on a remote repository an authentication is required. In this case the user must define an account for that repository in the application.
		</p>
		
		<h5>Remote repository accounts</h5>

		<p>
			In order to add an account for a remote repository, access the 'Tools -> Options' menu and in the dialog window select the 'General -> Product Library' tab.
		</p>

			<li>see the products distribution on timeline (either by day when possible, either by month)</li>
		</ul>

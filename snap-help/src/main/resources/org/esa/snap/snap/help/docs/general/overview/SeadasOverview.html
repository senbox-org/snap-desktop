<h4>SeaDAS General Overview</h4>
<p>
    SeaDAS is a comprehensive software package developed by NASA OBPG (Ocean Biology Processing Group) for the
    processing, display, analysis, and quality control of remote-sensing Earth data.  SeaDAS is open-source and
    serves as the official distribution point of the  <a href="SeadasOverview.html#SeaDASOCSSW">NASA OBPG Science Software (SeaDAS-OCSSW).</a>

    <br><br>

    The visualization and
    analysis tools can also be used on many other unsupported satellite missions. Customized algorithms can be
    developed and applied within SeaDAS to evaluate ocean, land and atmospheric data, as well as to produce
    true color imagery. SeaDAS can also integrate SeaBASS format field measurement (in situ) data for comparative
    analysis with relevant satellite data. Scientific data products can be exported from SeaDAS in file formats
    readily readable by many third party GIS analysis packages.
</p>




<a name="SeaDASPlatform"></a>
<h4>SeaDAS Platform</h4>
<p>
    SeaDAS 8 serves as an application platform to the NASA SeaDAS Toolbox.  The core elements of NASA SeaDAS
    science processing are contained within the SeaDAS ToolBox.  The SeaDAS Toolbox comes installed within
    the SeaDAS 8 Platform and can also can be installed directly within ESA SNAP.  SeaDAS 8 Platform is a NASA
    released version of SNAP which is branded and tailored to the needs of the SeaDAS user.

    <br><br>
    SeaDAS Platform Release Notes can be found at:<br>

</p>




<a name="SeaDASToolbox"></a>
<h4>SeaDAS Toolbox</h4>

<p>
    The core elements of NASA SeaDAS science processing are contained within the SeaDAS ToolBox.  This includes:
</p>

<li>the <a href="SeadasOverview.html#SeaDASOCSSW">NASA OBPG Science Software (SeaDAS-OCSSW).</a>
</li>

<li>a GUI interface to the NASA OBPG Science Software (SeaDAS-OCSSW) processors</li>

<li>additional useful tools relevant to the SeaDAS user and not present in either the SeaDAS platform or SNAP platform</li>

<a name="SeaDASOCSSW"></a>
<h4>NASA OBPG Science Software (SeaDAS-OCSSW)</h4>
<p>
    This is the official NASA science processing software (also known as OCSSW - Ocean Science Software)
    which applies the NASA OBPG (Ocean Biology Processing Group) algorithms to satellite data in order to characterize and
    calibrate the data and
    generate science quality OBPG products. Additional coinciding ancillary data are retrieved and used to correct
    for and calibrate out the atmospheric components of the signal in order to determine an Earth/ocean surface
    component of the signal and consequently to generate higher order products in the optical path such as
    Chlorophyll, SST, KD_490, etc.  SeaDAS processing provides a standardized data format across a multitude of
    satellites, currently supporting over 15 US and international satellite missions.

</p>





<a name="Sentinel3Toolbox"></a>
<h4>Sentinel 3 Toolbox</h4>
<p>This toolbox includes the ESA processors specific to the Sentinel 3 satellites.  This toolbox also contains the NASA
    science file readers specific to all NASA supported satellite missions.</p>



<a name="SNAPPlatform"></a>
<h4>SNAP Platform</h4>

<p>This ESA Platform is similar to the SeaDAS Platform without some of the SeaDAS specific tailored features.  The
    SeaDAS Toolbox may be installed directly within <a href="SnapOverview.html">SNAP</a>.</p>

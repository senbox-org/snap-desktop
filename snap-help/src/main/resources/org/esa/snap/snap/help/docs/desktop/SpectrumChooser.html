<p>
    The spectrum chooser is accessed by clicking <img src="images/icons/Filter24.gif"> in the
    <a href="SpectrumWindow.html">Spectrum View</a>.
    You can use the spectrum chooser to set which spectra or bands to display in the spectrum (or angular) view
    and to alter their appearance.<br>
    See below for a screenshot.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/SpectrumChooser.png"></p>

<p>
    Spectra are defined as band groups.
    You can add or change groups using the product's <a href="PropertyEditor.html">Property Editor</a>.
    Bands which are not included in a group will be displayed as "Other" or "Spectral bands".<br>
</p>

<p>
    You can select or deselect a spectrum by checking the box next to its name.
    Clicking <img src="images/icons/PlusSquaredButton.gif"> will bring up a sub-table which allows you to select
    and deselect distinct bands.
</p>

<p class="inote">
    <b>Tip:</b> When you have made a sub-selection of bands within a spectrum and
    then checked the respective spectrum box, checking it again will bring back your selection.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, you can choose a line style, a symbol, and the symbol size for each spectrum.
    You can also choose to use no symbol.
</p>

<p>The Spectrum Chooser provides the following tool buttons:<br><br>

<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/icons/document-open.png"></td>
        <td>Imports band configurations from a file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/icons/document-save.png"></td>
        <td>Exports band configurations to a file.</td>

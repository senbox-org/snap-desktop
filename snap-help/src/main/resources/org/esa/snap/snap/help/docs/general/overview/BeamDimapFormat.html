<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Sentinel Toolbox and the scientific data processors use a simple data input/output format,
    which makes it easy to import SNAP data in other imaging applications. The
    format is called 
    <object classid="java:eu.esa.snap.netbeans.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/dimap/spec/dimap.htm">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>DIMAP</u></html>">
    </object>
    and has been developed by SPOT-Image, France. The SNAP software uses a special
    DIMAP profile called BEAM-DIMAP.

<p>The BEAM-DIMAP is the standard I/O product format for the Sentinel Toolbox and the Scientific Tools.
    The format was chosen because it has a very simple and easy-to-understand structure.
    It was originally developed for the
    <object classid="java:eu.esa.snap.netbeans.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>BEAM toolbox and development platform</u></html>">
    </object>,hence the name.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>A data product stored in this format is composed of
<ul>
    <li>a single product header file with the suffix <code>.dim</code> in XML format containing the product meta-data</li>
    <li>an additional directory with the same name plus the suffix <code>.data</code><br/>
        <ul>
            <li>containing ENVI<sup>&reg;</sup>-compatible images for each band.</li>
            <li>containing a directory <code>tie_point_grids</code> which contains ENVI<sup>&reg;</sup>-compatible
                images for each tie-point grid
            </li>
            <li>containing a directory <code>vector_data</code>which contains the geometries in a proprietary format.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>The following diagram shows the structure:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/XMLAndRaw.jpg" width="510" height="420" border="0">

<p>The geo-coding of data products in satellite co-ordinates is stored in so called tie-point grid datasets.
    Tie-point datasets are stored in the data directory and have exactly the same format as the geophysical
    bands of a product.</p>

<p>Because of its simplicity, the product components can be accessed with nearly every
    image processing system or programming language. The product's metadata can directly
    be viewed in a text editor or an XML viewer. The following contains a closer look at the
    components of the product format.</p>

<p class="inote"><b>Important Note</b>: In the SNAP software, pixel values always refer to the upper
    left corner of the pixel. Map co-ordinates also typically refer to the upper left corner of the pixel.
    Pixel co-ordinates are always zero based, the pixel at <code>X=0,Y=0</code> refers to the upper left
    pixel of an image and the upper left corner of that pixel.</p>

<h3>XML Product Header</h3>

<p>XML stands for e<b>X</b>tensible <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage
    and is a mark-up language much like the better known HTML.</p>

<p>The most significant difference is that HTML is about displaying
    information, XML is about describing information. XML can be stored in plain
    text files and provides a data structuring scheme composed of elements and
    attributes. An element is enclosed by tags, but the tags are not predefined
    in XML. In order to use XML as a data storage, an application or standard
    must define its own tags. In this case, XML is very similar to HDF because
    the interpretation of the content is left to the application or, respectively,
    to the user.</p>

<p>The product header for a BEAM-DIMAP data product will contain
    two types of information</p>

<ul>
    <li>meta-data describing the image data contained in the product</li>
    <li>the geophysical bands and tie point grids of the product as references to the
        actual image data files, since the image data is not stored in XML format</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason why the image data is not directly stored in XML
    is simple: The product header is plain text, and an image stored in text format
    requires about 4 to 10 times more space than the simplest binary format and
    therefore requires considerable processing overhead when reading to and writing
    from such files.</p>

<h3>Image Data Format</h3>

<p>One geophysical band in the data product is represented by a single image.
    The image data - the data product's geophysical samples - are stored in flat binary
    files in big endian order. What makes this format compatible with the simple ENVI
    image format is that an extra image header for each image is also stored: the ENVI header.
</p>
<a name="envihdr"></a>

<h3>ENVI Header File Format</h3>

<p>The header files also have plain text format and comprise key-values pairs
    describing storage layout of the raw data in terms of raster width, height
    and the sample data type. In addition to ENVI, multiple other imaging applications
    are capable of importing image files having flat binary format. Here is an example of
    a header file:</p>

<pre>
    ENVI
    samples = 1100
    lines = 561
    bands = 1
    header offset = 0
    file type = ENVI Standard
    data type = 4
    interleave = bsq
    byte order = 1
</pre>

<p>An ENVI header file starts with the text string <code>ENVI</code> to be recognized by ENVI as
    a native file header. Keywords within the file are used to indicate critical file information. The
    following keywords are used by the BEAM-DIMAP format:
</p>

<table>

    <tr><td><code>description</code></td> <td>a character string describing the image or processing performed.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>samples</code></td> <td>number of samples (pixels) per image line for each band.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>lines</code></td> <td>number of lines per image for each band.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>bands</code></td> <td>number of bands per image file. <b>For BEAM-DIMAP the value is always <code>
        1</code> (one).</b></td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>header offset</code></td> <td>refers to the number of bytes of imbedded header information present
        in the file. These bytes are skipped when the ENVI file is read. <b>For BEAM-DIMAP the value is always <code>
        0</code>.</b></td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>file type</code></td> <td>refers to specific ENVI defined file types such as certain data formats and
        processing results. <b>For BEAM-DIMAP the value is always the string <code>"ENVI Standard"</code></b>.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>data type</code></td> <td>parameter identifying the type of data representation, where 1=8 bit byte;
        2=16-bit signed integer; 3=32-bit signed long integer; 4=32-bit floating point; 5=64-
        bit double precision floating point; 6=2x32-bit complex, real-imaginary pair of
        double precision; 9=2x64-bit double precision complex, real-imaginary pair of
        double precision; 12=16-bit unsigned integer; 13=32-bit unsigned long integer;
        14=64-bit unsigned integer; and 15=64-bit unsigned long integer.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>interleave</code></td> <td>refers to whether the data are band sequential (BSQ), band interleaved by
        pixel (BIP),
        or band interleaved by line (BIL). <b>For BEAM-DIMAP the value is always <code>"bsq"</code></b>.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>byte order</code></td> <td>describes the order of the bytes in integer, long integer, 64-bit integer,
        unsigned 64-bit integer, floating point, double precision, and complex data types;
        Byte order=0 is Least Significant Byte First (LSF) data (DEC and MS-DOS systems)
        and byte order=1 is Most Significant Byte First (MSF) data (all others - SUN, SGI,
        IBM, HP, DG). <b>For BEAM-DIMAP the value is always <code>1</code> (Most Significant Byte First = Big Endian
        Order)</b>.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>x-start</code> and <code>y-start</code></td> <td>parameters define the image coordinates for the upper
        left hand
        pixel in the image. The values in the header file are specified in "file coordinates,"
        which is a zero-based number.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>map info</code></td> <td>lists geographic coordinates information in the order of projection name
        (UTM), reference pixel x location in file coordinates, pixel y, pixel easting, pixel
        northing, x pixel size, y pixel size, Projection Zone, "North" or "South" for UTM
        only.</td></tr>


    <tr><td><code>projection info</code></td> <td>parameters that describe user-defined projection information. This
        keyword is added to the ENVI header file if a user-defined projection is used instead
        of a standard projection.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>band names</code></td> <td>allows entry of specific names for each band of an image.</td></tr>

    <tr><td><code>wavelength</code></td> <td>lists the center wavelength values of each band in an image.</td></tr>

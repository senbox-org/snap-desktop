<h4>Pin Management in the Sentinel Toolbox</h4>

<p>
    A pin is a marker for a certain geographical position within a geo-referenced image.
    The properties of a pin are
<ul>
    <li>the geographical co-ordinate,</li>
    <li>a graphical symbol,</li>
    <li>the name (label),</li>
    <li>and a textual description.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Pins are displayed as symbols at their geographical positions in image views associated
    with the current product. Pins are stored in the current product and available again if the
    product is re-opened.<br>
    In the Sentinel Toolbox, pins can be used to "freeze" the
    <a href="ProductExplorer.html#pixelView">Pixel Info View</a> and the
    <a href="SpectrumWindow.html">Spectrum View</a> to the selected pin in order to display
    the values of the pixel associated with the selected pin.<br>
    New pins can be created with the <a href="#pinTool">Pin Tool</a> and removed using the
    <a href="EditMenu.html">delete pin</a> command in the Edit Menu.
    It is also possible to create and remove pins by using the <a href="#pinManager">Pin Manager</a>.

<p>
    When creating a <a href="ProductSubsetDialog.html">spatial subset</a> of a product which contains pins, the pins
    located outside of the spatial area
    will not be copied to the resulting product.

<p>
    <a name="pinTool"><b>The Pin Tool &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></a><img src="images/icons/PinTool24.gif"><br/>
    The Pin Tool is used to create a new pin. If the Pin Tool is active, a click into an image view
    creates a new pin at the current cursor position.<br>
    <a name="selectTool"><b>The Select Tool &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></a><img src="images/icons/SelectTool24.gif"><br/>
    Selecting existing pins can be done with the Select Tool. If you click on an existing pin with the Select Tool
    it becomes the selected pin. If you double-click on an existing pin the <a href="#editPinDialog">Edit Pin</a> dialog
    appears
    and lets you edit the properties of the selected Pin.


<h4><a name="pinManager">The Pin Manager &nbsp;&nbsp;</a><img src="images/icons/PinManager24.gif"></h4>

<p>
    The pin manager is used to display all pins stored in the current product within a
    table and provides some pin related operations.

<p align="center"><img src="images/PinManager.png"></p>

<p>
    The X- and Y-coordinates refer to the pixel positions in the reference raster of the product.
    If you click on a pin within the table it becomes the selected pin.
    Double-clicking on a table cell will allow you to edit the values.
</p>

<p>In the following the tool buttons of the pin manager are explained.</p>

<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/icons/New24.gif"></td>
        <td>Creates a new pin and adds it to the product. If no style is set in the creation dialog, a color is set by
            cycling through a set of predefined colors.

    <tr>

        <td>Exports selected part of the displayed table to a flat text
            file.
            The exported text is tabulator-separated and may therefore be import directly into a spreadsheet application
            (e.g. MS Excel).
        </td>
    </tr>

<h4><a name="editPinDialog">The Edit Pin Dialog</a></h4>

<p>
    The pin edit dialog is used to edit the properties of a pin after a new pin has been created or after a
    selected pin has been double-clicked. This dialog is also available in the pin manager.

<p align="center"><img src="images/PinEditor.png"></p>

<p>The editable pin properties are
<ul>
    <li>the geographical co-ordinate, which can also been given as pixel position</li>
    <li>the name for the pin</li>
    <li>a textual description</li>
</ul>

<p>The graphical properties of the pin can be set by entering cascading style sheets into the 'Style css'-field.
    Allowed properties are:
<ul>
    <li>symbol: one of {pin,cross,plus,star,square,circle}</li>
    <li>fill: any color in one of the following formats {#rrggbb; rrggbb; rrr,ggg,bbb}</li>
    <li>fill-opacity: any value between 0.0 and 1.0</li>
    <li>stroke: same as fill</li>
    <li>stroke-opacity: same as fill-opacity</li>
    <li>stroke-width: any value greater than 0.0</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    Example:
    <code>symbol:pin;fill:#00AAFF;fill-opacity:0.0;stroke:#FF00FF;stroke-opacity:0.2;stroke-width:0.5</code>
</p>

<p>
    However, it is easier by far to edit the pin's styles using the <a href="LayerManagerWindow.html">Layer Editors</a>.

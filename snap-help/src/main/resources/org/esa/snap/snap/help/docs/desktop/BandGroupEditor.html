<h3>Band Grouping Editor</h3>

<p>
    This dialog allows you to define, edit and manage Band Groups. A Band Group is a list of Bands of a product that can be
    grouped and given a group name. This functionality is similar to the auto-grouping entities provided by the ProductReader.
    The bands are defined as string-representation by their name. It does not matter if the bands are contained in a single
    product, the selection by group is just checking for matching names.

    <p>
        If e.g. a certain set of wavelengths is required as input, several names from different product types can be mixed into
        a single group:
        "radiance_08, radiance_09, OA08_radiance, OA09_radiance, M08_radiance, M09_radiance"
        will select 681nm and 709nm bands from OLCI and MERIS (old and new naming).

    <p>

    User defined groups can be used in the <a href="ProductSubsetDialog.html">Product Subset Dialog</a>, the <a href="PinManagement.html">Pin Manager</a> and in the <a href="SpectrumWindow.html">SpectrumView</a>
    to simplify handling of common band group definitions that are frequently used.

    The Band Group definitions are kept as a user-defined property and saved in a text file for easy manual editing of sharing.
    This file is stored at .snap/config/user_band_groups.json.

<h3>Band Grouping Editor</h3>

<p>
    This dialog allows you define, edit and manage Band Groups. A Band Group is a list of Bands of a product that can be
    grouped and given a group name. This functionality is similar to the auto-grouping entities provided by the ProductReader.

    User defined groups can be used in the <a href="ProductSubsetDialog.html">Product Subset Dialog</a> and in the <a href="SpectrumWindow.html">SpectrumView</a>
    to simplify handling of common band group definitions that are frequently used.

    The Band Group definitions are kept as a user-defined property and saved in a text file for easy manual editing of sharing.
    This file is stored at .snap/config/user_band_groups.json.

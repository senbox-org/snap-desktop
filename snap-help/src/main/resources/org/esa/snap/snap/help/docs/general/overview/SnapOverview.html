<h3>SNAP</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <b>Sentinel Application Platform</b> - or <b>SNAP</b>
- in short is a collection of executable tools and Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) which have been developed to facilitate
the utilisation, viewing and processing of a variety of remotely sensed
data. The functionality of SNAP is accessed through the <b>Sentinel
Toolbox</b>. The purpose of the Sentinel Toolbox is not to
duplicate existing commercial packages, but to complement them with
functions dedicated to the handling of data products of earth observing
satellites.</p>

<p>The main components of the Sentinel Toolbox are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An intuitive desktop application used for EO data
visualisation, analysing and processing.</li>
<li>A set of scientific data processors running either from the
command-line or invoked by the desktop application. </li>
<li>The command-line tool <b>gpt</b> (graph
processing tool) is used to execute processing graphs made up of <i>operators</i>
nodes developed using the SNAP GPF (see Java API below). </li>
<li>A data product converter tool <b>pconvert</b>
allowing a user to convert raw data products to the <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a> standard
format, to <a href="../geotiff/ExportGeoTIFF.html">GeoTIFF</a>,
to <a href="../../visat/ExportHDF.html">HDF-5</a>
or to RGB images. </li>
<li>A <b>Java&#8482; API</b> which provides ready-to-use
components for remote sensing related application development and
plug-in points for new SNAP extension modules. Besides a number of
extension points such as product reader and writers, the SNAP API
comprises the <b>Graph Processing Framework</b> (GPF)
which is used to rapidly create raster data processors. The <b>Rich
Client Platform</b> is used to develop rich GUI user interface
applications based on SNAP.</li>
</ul><h4>Standard Product Format</h4>
<p>The Sentinel Toolbox application and the scientific data
processors use a simple data input/output format, which makes it easy
to import data in other imaging applications. The format is called
DIMAP<sup>®</sup>
and has been developed by SPOT-Image, France. The SNAP software uses a
special DIMAP profile called <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a>,
which has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single product header (XML) containing the product
meta-data</li>
<li>An associated data directory containing ENVI<sup>®</sup>-compatible
images for each band.</li>
<li>Each image in the directory is composed of a header file
(ASCII text) and an image data file (flat binary)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Source Code</h4>
<p>The complete SNAP software has been developed under the GNU
public license and comes with full source code (Java<sup>TM</sup>). The source code is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org">https://github.com/senbox-org</a></p>
<h4>Supported Platforms</h4>
<p>SNAP is programmed in pure Java&#8482; to allow a maximum
portability. The SNAP software has been successfully tested under MS
Windows&#8482;&nbsp;XP<sup>®</sup>,&nbsp;Vista,&nbsp;7,8,10 and also Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X and as well as
under Linux and Solaris<sup>®</sup> operating systems.</p>

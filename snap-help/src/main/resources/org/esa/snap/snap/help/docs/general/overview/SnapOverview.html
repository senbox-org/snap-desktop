<h3>SNAP</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The <b>Sentinel Application Platform</b> - or <b>SNAP</b>
    - in short is a collection of executable tools and Application
    Programming Interfaces (APIs) which have been developed to facilitate
    the utilisation, viewing and processing of a variety of remotely sensed
    data. The functionality of SNAP is accessed through the <b>Sentinel
        Toolbox</b>. The purpose of the Sentinel Toolbox is not to
    duplicate existing commercial packages, but to complement them with
    functions dedicated to the handling of data products of earth observing
    satellites.</p>

<p>The main components of the Sentinel Toolbox are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An intuitive desktop application used for EO data
        visualisation, analysing and processing.
    </li>
    <li>A set of scientific data processors running either from the
        command-line or invoked by the desktop application.
    </li>
    <li>The command-line tool <b>gpt</b> (graph
        processing tool) is used to execute processing graphs made up of <i>operators</i>
        nodes developed using the SNAP GPF (see Java API below).
    </li>
    <li>A data product converter tool <b>pconvert</b>
        allowing a user to convert raw data products to the <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a> standard
        format, to <a href="nbdocs://org.esa.snap.snap.geotiff/org/esa/snap/snap/geotiff/docs/geotiff/ExportGeoTIFF.html">GeoTIFF</a>,
        to <a href="../../desktop/ExportHDF.html">HDF-5</a>
        or to RGB images.
    </li>
    <li>A <b>Java&#8482; API</b> which provides ready-to-use
        components for remote sensing related application development and
        plug-in points for new SNAP extension modules. Besides a number of
        extension points such as product reader and writers, the SNAP API
        comprises the <b>Graph Processing Framework</b> (GPF)
        which is used to rapidly create raster data processors. The <b>Rich
            Client Platform</b> is used to develop rich GUI user interface
        applications based on SNAP.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Standard Product Format</h4>
<p>The Sentinel Toolbox application and the scientific data
    processors use a simple data input/output format, which makes it easy
    to import data in other imaging applications. The format is called
    DIMAP<sup>&reg;</sup>
    and has been developed by SPOT-Image, France. The SNAP software uses a
    special DIMAP profile called <a href="BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a>,
    which has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A single product header (XML) containing the product
        meta-data.
    </li>
    <li>An associated data directory containing ENVI<sup>&reg;</sup>-compatible
        images for each band.
    </li>
    <li>Each image in the directory is composed of a header file
        (ASCII text) and an image data file (flat binary).
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Source Code</h4>
<p>The complete SNAP software has been developed under the GNU
    public license and comes with full source code (Java<sup>TM</sup>). The source code is available on GitHub
    <object classid="java:eu.esa.snap.netbeans.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="https://github.com/senbox-org">
        <param name="text" value="<html><u>https://github.com/senbox-org</u></html>">
    </object>.
</p>
<h4>Supported Platforms</h4>
<p>SNAP is programmed in pure Java&#8482; to allow a maximum
    portability. The SNAP software has been successfully tested under MS
    Windows&#8482;&nbsp;XP<sup>&reg;</sup>,&nbsp;Vista,&nbsp;7,8,10 and also Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X and as well as
    under Linux and Solaris<sup>&reg;</sup> operating systems.</p>

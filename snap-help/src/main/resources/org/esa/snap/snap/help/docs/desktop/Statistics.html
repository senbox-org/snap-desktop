    The Statistics tool enables you to process and view statistics and relevent metadata for any file loaded within
    SeaDAS.  The statistics result can be refined to a particular region of interest and masking criteria.  The statistics
    may be done for a single band or simultaneously for any and/or all bands within a file.  A spreadsheet captures
    these statistics for easy viewing and export to other spreadsheet program.  A histogram and percentile plot can also
    be simultaneously generated.  This tool is available both from the GUI and from the
    command
    line.

</p>


<p>

    The following image illustrates the results of applying this tool to a level-2 file with a masking criteria applied
    for various regional water bodies.

<h4><i>Binning Resolution</i></h4>
<br>

    <!--<i>Figure ?. The bands selector<br></i>-->
</div>

<br>

<p class="i1">
    The histogram and percentile plots are created from the binned statistics and hence are dependent on the bin width,
    which derives from the number of bins and the bin span.  The above image illustrates an example of an issue you may
    encounter if you do not have a reasonable bin resolution.  This example uses the chlor_a product of a level-2 file,
    for the full scene.
    The image on the left has a bin count of 1,000 and the image on the right has a bin count of 100,000.
    Both span the default value range of statistics min and statistics max.
     The plot x-axis span has been reduced to span from 0.0 to 0.4.  Keep in mind that the high end of chlor_a can be up to
    100.0, which is the high end of its valid pixel expression.  Since, for this example, the majority of the
    data occurs in only a small portion of the binning span data range, a total bin count of 1,000, as shown in the left image,
    does a poor job of identifying the histogram and data structure.

<h4><i>Regional and Quality Masking</i></h4>



<p class="i1">
    SeaDAS enables the masking out of unwanted pixels, so that the statistics can be done on only the pixels which
    meet the masking criteria.  Conceptually, there are 2 types of masking: regional and quality.
    The first type is region based where you have
    defined a specific area of interest on the Earth, and pixels outside of this are intended to be masked out.  Region masking, by
    it's very nature is stable across time and not effected by temporal changes such as atmospheric parameters, sunglint, straylight, etc.
      These latter parameters can be considered quality parameters.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <i>Note: The primary advantage in splitting out the regional masking from the quality masking is that
    is enables calculate of total pixels in a region, and subsequent calculation of fraction of valid pixels. </i>

</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>For GPT:</b><br>Again there are 2 methods by which SeaDAS applies the masks
     but with is a slight nuanced difference when running from the command line.  In this case, relevant to the description above,
    you can supply as parameters a shapefile and a validPixelExpression.  The shapefile automatically loads into SeaDAS, and creates
    the region of interest mask.  If you want to added in validation masking you will need to do this with the validPixelExpression.
</p>
<p class="i1">
    <i>Note: when editing the validPixelExpression to include any custom validation parameters, keep in mind that you are overwriting the
        default validPixelExpression (for example for chlor_a you will want to do something like this: chlor_a > 0.001 &&
        chlor_a <= 100 && !STRAYLIGHT && !HIGLINT).

    </i>
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_______________
<h4><i>Statistics and Mapped Imagery</i></h4>



<p class="i1">
    In general, it may be best to consider mapping a file one way for statistics and another way for displaying data.
    For statistics you are best served using an equal area map projection (such as Albers Conic Equal Area, Lambert
    Azimuthal
    Equal Area, Sinusoidal, ...). With an equal area projection, the Earth surface area is the same for each resultant
    pixel and can be treated as such with an equal per pixel weighting. However, for large scenes, an equal area map
    projection
    may not look natural so using a conformal projection (such as Mercator and Stereographic) is
    more ideal when displaying this type of imagery.
</p>
<p class="i1">

    <i>Note: selection of the "best" map projection is dependent on scene size (is it global, regional, local), scene
        shape
        (does it run narrow north-south, narrow west-east, or is it more square in shape), and scene location (is it at
        the
        equator, at one of the Poles, or some span of latitudes somewhere between the Pole and equator.</i>

</p>

<br><br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_______________
<h4><i>Earth-Surface Pixel Area Considerations for Level-2 Files</i></h4>
<p class="i1">
When choosing to not reproject and to do statistics directly on a level-2 file, you should take into consideration the fact that
    for most missions not all pixels in the
    level-2 file will have an equal Earth surface area.  Pixels with a high sensor zenith angle can be substantially of greater
    surface area than those at a low sensor zenith angle.

    If you constrain your analysis to a region (grid box) size which limits this mix of large and small surface
    area pixels, statistics done directly on level-2 files can be more meaningful.
    <p>
<br>

<div class="center">
    <img src="images/StatisticsPixelArea.png" border="0"> <br>
    <i> <br></i>
<</div>
<br>

<p class="i1">

    The table above illustrates for MODIS (the 1km bands) the percent difference of surface area between the smallest and
    largest pixels of several grid box sizes.  The significant impact of sensor zenith angle on this is readily apparent.
    This table can be helpful in determining whether a particular grid box size is appropriate for your particular scene.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <i>
        The following math band equation was used to determine pixel surface area for MODIS Aqua:
1.0*pow(((6371*sin((senz*PI/180)- (asin((6371/(6371+700))*sin(senz*PI/180))))/sin(asin((6371/(6371+700))*sin(senz*PI/180))))/700),2.0)/cos(senz*PI/180)
        </i>
</p>

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_______________
<h4><i>Statistics on Virtual Files and Virtual Bands</i></h4>


<p class="i1">
    Statistics done on a virtual file can be extremely slow.  And if done on a chain of virtual files
     can bog down to the point where the computer memory or some other issue just won't let
    the operation proceed.  Try to avoid where possible these chains of virtual files and bands.  If the file on which
    you are about to do statistics is a virtual file, you should consider first saving it (which transforms it into a real file),
    and then generating your statistics.
    </p>




<br>
<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_______________
<h4><i>Metadata Fields</i></h4>


<p class="i1">
    Metadata fields can be included with the statistics output.  These fields are invaluable in documenting your statistics,
    especially if you run statistics and export the results individually for many files, and then gather it all together
    into a spreadsheet package or other package.  Unlike statistics, which are precise numbers generated by exact
    algorithms based on data, metadata is quite dependent and reliant on the type and source of the file.  SeaDAS makes
    its best effort at gathering together the metadata of a file to include with the statistics.  This help document
    defines how each metadata field is searched for within a file.

</p>
<p class="i2first">
    <i>Note: versions of SeaDAS prior to 7.5 calculated the median by binned the data and then obtaining the 50 percentile
        value.  This method is a quicker calculation especially in the case of a large data set, but is dependent on the bin size.
        This field is still available as the'Median(Binned)' field.  </i>
</p>
<p class="i2first">
    <i>Note: because, especially for larger files, the processing time can increase, this field is optional and you can

    This is information about the band.  It is obtained directly from the loaded band.  If you wish to edit this
    band information within the SeaDAS GUI, right-click on a band in the FileManager, then select Properties, then
    edit the fields.  Now when you run statistics, your edited value will appear in the results.

<h4><i>File MetaData</i></h4>

<p class="i1first">
    This is information about the file.
</p>


<p class="i1hang"><b>File</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The name of the file "as loaded" into SeaDAS.  The file name can be changed within SeaDAS, yet
    the original file still exists on your machine.  If you change the file name within SeaDAS (File Manager: right-click
    file, then Properties, then edit Name), this new file name will be the name displayed by this field.
</p>


<p class="i1hang"><b>File_Format</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    This is the format of the file "as loaded" into SeaDAS.  SeaDAS contains internal readers
    for many satellites and data levels.  If you open the file in the GUI the default way (File > Open), then SeaDAS will
    determine which reader to use on the file.  For example a standard OB.DAAC level-2 file when loaded in will use a
    level-2 file reader resulting in field "File_Format=SeaDAS-L2".  If you instead import the file using
    File > Import > NetCDF-CF, the NetCDF-CF reader will be invoked and the resulting field will be "File_Format=NetCDF-CF.
</p>


<p class="i1hang"><b>File_Type</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    This is the file type determined "as loaded" into SeaDAS.  It is dependent on the reader used
    internally within SeaDAS to load the file.  It follows the same logic used in obtaining the "File_Format" mentioned
    above and is somewhat similar in meaning to that field.
</p>


<p class="i1hang"><b>File_Width</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The width of the file raster.

<p class="i1hang"><b>Sensor</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The name of the sensor which acquired the data.  This field is obtained from the Global
    attributes of the metadata.  The following attribute names are searched: "sensor_name", "instrument", "sensor".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Sensor".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>



<p class="i1hang"><b>Platform</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The name of the platform (satellite) on which the sensor is mounted which acquired the data.
    This field is obtained from the Global
    attributes of the metadata.  The following attribute name is looked for: "platform".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Platform".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>



<p class="i1hang"><b>Resolution</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The ground surface resolution (at nadir) of the data.  This field is obtained from the Global
    attributes of the metadata.  The following attribute names are searched:  "spatial_resolution", "resolution".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Resolution".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>




<p class="i1hang"><b>Day_Night</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    Indicates whether the data was imaged during daylight or at night.
    This field is obtained from the Global attributes of the metadata.
    The following attribute names are searched: "day_night_flag", "day_night".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Day_Night".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>




<p class="i1hang"><b>Orbit</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The orbit revolution count of the satellite.
    The following attribute names are searched: "orbit_number", "orbit".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Orbit".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
    Files may span multiple orbits so this is searched as well.
    The following attribute names are searched: "start_orbit_number", "end_orbit", "end_orbit_number", "end_orbit".
    If anything is found within this orbit number span search then the start and end orbit number are assigned to
    the statistics field "Orbit".
</p>



<p class="i1hang"><b>Processing_Version</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The processing version of the software which created the file.
    This field is obtained from the Global attributes of the metadata.
    The following attribute names are searched: "processing_version".

    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
</p>


<p class="i1hang"><b>Projection</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The map projection of the file.  If the file currently has a coordinate reference system
    defined for it within SeaDAS, then this is displayed along with the words "(obtained from CrsGeoCoding)".
    If not, then an attempt is made to obtain this from the Global attributes of the metadata.
    The following attribute names are searched: "map_projection","projection", "crs".
    If one of these attributes is present then that value gets assigned to the statistics field "Projection"
    along with the words "(obtained from MetaData)".
    Upper-case and camel-case variants of these fields are searched as well.
    Lastly, if no projection has been found then a java class is displayed.  OB.DAAC level-2 files will indicate
    the class "BowtiePixelGeoCoding".

    file from multiple input files each of a specific time.  Each band in the output file came from a source file and
    the band is named based on the time of the input file.
    So the statistics tool obtained the time series metadata directly from the name of the band.  If you wish to edit this
    time information within the SeaDAS GUI, right-click on the band in the FileManager, then select Properties, then
    edit the band name.  Now when you run statistics, your edited value will appear in the results.

</p>


<p class="i1hang"><b>Date</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The date portion of the band time.
</p>


<p class="i1hang"><b>Time</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    The time of day portion of the band time.

    In addition to the numerical statistics and associated metadata, the Statistics tools can produce two plots:
    a histogram plot and a percentile plot.  You can choose whether to generate them in the "View" parameter tab.
    You can choose a general format to be applied to all the plots in the "Plots" parameter tab.  For convenience
    and readability the x-axis of both plots is by default formatted identically.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Note: Versions of SeaDAS prior to
        7.5 had the percentile plot inverted with percentile being on the x-axis.  </i>

<p>
    Once you have created the plots, you can more extensively format them.  You can edit the range for either axis,
    edit the axis labels, add a title, alter the colors, and more.  To do this, simply right click on the image of
    the plot and select "Properties".  The above editor window will appear.  You edit these plots one at a time,
    so consider using the "Plots" parameter tab for setting this before run.

    This creates plots where the domain (x-axis) spans the specified thresholds.
</p>
<p class="i2first">
    <i>
        Hint: this feature can be quite useful, especially when
        a large portion of your data only occupies a narrow span of the full valid range of the data.  By not plotting
        the high and low outliers you can better "see" the data, and better determine whether your specified bin
        resolution is high enough.  If you try this out on chlor_a in a full scene level-2 file, you will likely
        observe that a bin count of 1000 bins crams most data into just couple bins, whereas a higher bin count such as
        10,000 or 100,000 bins will spreads the data out across many bins resulting in a better looking plot and more
        meaningful percent threshold results.
    </i>
</p>
<p class="i2first">
    <i>
        Note: since the percent thresholds are determined from histogram-based binning, the plot range is affected by
        your bining criteria specification in the "Bins" parameter window.
    </i>
</p>




<p class="i1hang"><b>Set Domain: (by Value)</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    This creates plots where the domain (x-axis) span the specified value.
</p>
<p class="i2first">
    <i>
        Note: this is value specific and not all bands have the same units and value range.  This tool allows
        for the simultaneous generation of statistics for multiple bands and setting the domain by value may cause
        some bands for have plots whose domain does not capture the data.  Because of issue,
        this field is not available in the Preferences
    </i>
</p>



<p class="i1hang"><b>Set Size</b></p>
<p class="i2first">
    This sets the size (in pixels) on the plots generated within the statistics window.  If deselected then the plots
    are auto-sized in an attempt by SeaDAS to "best fit" the plots into the GUI window.  If you select this parameter
    then the plots will be generated with the exact pixel sizing specified in the "Width" and "Height" fields.
</p>
<p class="i2first">
    <i>
    Note: this size includes the pixels used for the axis labels and axis titles.  Consequently setting the same value

<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>
<p>
    The Land/Water Mask Algorithm takes the geographic bounds of the input product and creates a new
    product covering the same area. The output product contains a single band, which indicates if a pixel is land or water.
    For each pixel, it contains the fraction of water; a value of 0.0 indicates land, a value of 100.0 indicates water,
    and every value in between indicates a mixed pixel.<br>
    Since the base data may exhibit a higher resolution than the input product, a subsampling &ge;1 may be specified. In this case for each
    resulting sub-pixel the it is computed if its land or water. Averaging the sub-pixel gives the fraction of water covered by the macro-pixel.<br>
    There are two auxiliary data sets on which the watermask can be based.
</p>


<h4>High-Resolution Dataset</h4>
<p>The high-res dataset is based on data given by
    <object classid="java:eu.esa.snap.netbeans.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/">
        <param name="text" value="<html>SRTM</html>">
    </object>
    -shapefiles between 60° north and 58° south, and by the
    <object classid="java:eu.esa.snap.netbeans.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://due.esrin.esa.int/page_globcover.php">
        <param name="text" value="<html>GlobCover</html>">
        world map above 60° north.
        Below 58° south, this dataset does not contain any data, so the resulting product will contain the fill value
        for these parts.
        This high-res dataset will be employed when the resolution parameter is set to 50m or 150m.

<h4>Low-Resolution Data Set</h4>
<p>The second dataset is based on
    <object classid="java:eu.esa.snap.netbeans.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/gshhs.html">
        <param name="text" value="<html>GSHHS</html>">
        data in a resolution of 1 km. It covers the whole earth, and will be employed
        when the resolution parameter is set to 1000.

SNAP Release Notes
==================
    
# New in SNAP 7.0
The naming of attribute features of ESRI shapefiles has changed: 
Threshold variable names are shortened by getting rid of the threshold name part 
altogether (e.g., p_90_threshold now becomes simply p_90) and indexes are not 
incremented per measure, but correspond to a band name or a time interval
(e.g., vrg_4_2 will correspond to the average of band 4 during time interval 2).

# New in SNAP v3.0

### New Features and Important Changes
* A new Resampling Operator has been introduced. Its main purpose is to make the bands of a multi-size 
product equal in size. It is possible to choose for the resampling different aggregation and 
interpolation methods. If a user invokes an action which can not handle multi-size products the user is 
asked to resample the product.   
* New function *bit_set(bandName, bitNumber)* in Band Maths available. The method tests if the bit at 
the specified number is set or not.
* GPF operators can now compute multi-size target products. To do so the computeTile(band, tile) must 
be implemented. In order to reflect a dynamic state created in the initialize() method (the source 
and therefore the target is single-size) the methods *boolean canComputeTile()* and 
*boolean canComputeTileStack()* can be overridden.
* GPF operators can now access a product manager *Operator.getProductManager()*. This is useful to 
provide auxiliary products to other operators in the graph. 
* Support for quicklooks have been integrated in Products Explorer and Product Library
* Operations to perform land masking have been added.
* The operator LinearTodB has been renamed to LinearToFromdB

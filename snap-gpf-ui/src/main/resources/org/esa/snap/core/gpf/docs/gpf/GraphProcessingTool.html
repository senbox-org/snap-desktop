<h1>The SNAP Graph Processing Tool (gpt)</h1>

<pre>
    Usage:
      gpt &lt;op&gt;|&lt;graph-file&gt; [options] [&lt;source-file-1&gt; &lt;source-file-2&gt; ...]

    Description:
      This tool is used to execute SNAP raster data operators in batch-mode. The
      operators can be used stand-alone or combined as a directed acyclic graph
      (DAG). Processing graphs are represented using XML. More info about
      processing graphs, the operator API, and the graph XML format can be found
      in the SNAP documentation.

    Arguments:
      &lt;op&gt;               Name of an operator. See below for the list of &lt;op&gt;s.
      &lt;graph-file&gt;       Operator graph file (XML format).
      &lt;source-file-i&gt;    The &lt;i&gt;th source product file. The actual number of source
                         file arguments is specified by &lt;op&gt;. May be optional for
                         operators which use the -S option.

    Options:
      -h                 Displays command usage. If &lt;op&gt; is given, the specific
                         operator usage is displayed.
      -e                 Displays more detailed error messages. Displays a stack
                         trace, if an exception occurs.
      -t &lt;file&gt;          The target file. Default value is './target.dim'.
      -f &lt;format&gt;        Output file format, e.g. 'GeoTIFF', 'HDF5',
                         'BEAM-DIMAP'. If not specified, format will be derived
                         from the target filename extension, if any, otherwise the
                         default format is 'BEAM-DIMAP'. Ony used, if the graph
                         in &lt;graph-file&gt; does not specify its own 'Write' operator.
      -p &lt;file&gt;          A (Java Properties) file containing processing
                         parameters in the form &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; or a XML file
                         containing a a parameter DOM for the operator. Entries in this
                         file are overwritten by the -P&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; command-line
                         option (see below). The following variables are substituted in
                         the parameters file:
                             ${gpt.operator} (given by the 'op' argument)
                             ${gpt.graphFile} (given by the 'graph-file' argument)
                             ${gpt.parametersFile} (given by the -p option)
                             ${gpt.targetFile} (given by the -t option)
                             ${gpt.targetFormat} (given by the -f option)
      -c &lt;cache-size&gt;    Sets the tile cache size in bytes. Value can be suffixed
                         with 'K', 'M' and 'G'. Must be less than maximum
                         available heap space. If equal to or less than zero, tile
                         caching will be completely disabled. The default tile
                         cache size is '512M'.
      -q &lt;parallelism&gt;   Sets the maximum parallelism used for the computation, i.e.
                         the maximum number of parallel (native) threads.
                         The default parallelism is '8'.
      -x                 Clears the internal tile cache after writing a complete
                         row of tiles to the target product file. This option may
                         be useful if you run into memory problems.
      -T&lt;target&gt;=&lt;file&gt;  Defines a target product. Valid for graphs only. &lt;target&gt;
                         must be the identifier of a node in the graph. The node's
                         output will be written to &lt;file&gt;.
      -S&lt;source&gt;=&lt;file&gt;  Defines a source product. &lt;source&gt; is specified by the
                         operator or the graph. In an XML graph, all occurrences of
                         ${&lt;source&gt;} will be replaced with references to a source
                         product located at &lt;file&gt;.
      -P&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;   Defines a processing parameter, &lt;name&gt; is specific for the
                         used operator or graph. In an XML graph, all occurrences of
                         ${&lt;name&gt;} will be replaced with &lt;value&gt;. Overwrites
                         parameter values specified by the '-p' option.
      -D&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;   Defines a system property for this invocation.
      -v &lt;dir&gt;           A directory containing any number of Velocity templates.
                         Each template generates a text output file along with the
                         target product. This feature has been added to support a
                         flexible generation of metadata files.
                         See http://velocity.apache.org/ and option -m.
      -m &lt;file&gt;          A (Java Properties) file containing (constant) metadata
                         in the form &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt; or any XML file. Its primary
                         usage is to provide an additional context to be used
                         from within the Velocity templates. See option -v.
      --diag             Displays version and diagnostic information.

<h3>The user interface</h3>
<p>The interface consists in 3 screens which allow the following operations: create new adapter, edit, duplicate and
    delete an existing adapter, executing an adapter.</p>

<h4>Managing the existing adapters</h4>
<p>This form, having the title <i>'External Tools'</i>, lists all the currently defined adapters, with a bottom button band that contains
    actions for creating a new adapter, duplicating an existing adapter, editing, deleting and executing an adapter.
    On the top, one can set the location from where adapters are read by double-clicking the area from the right of the label "Adapters location".
    Below it, there is a list of the adapters where the user can select an adapter to execute one of the aforementioned actions.</p>
<p>This form can be invoked by using the menu <i>Tools->Manage external tools</i> of the SNAP application.</p>

<h4>Creating a new adapter or modifying an existing one</h4>
<p>The form for creating a new adapter is reused for editing an existing adapter and for duplicating an adapter.</p>
<p>Go <a href="adapter_editor.html">here</a> to see details about editing an adapter.</p>

<h4>Executing an adapter from SNAP</h4>
<p>When executing an already defined adapter, some actions are necessary in the execution form:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choosing the source products, either by selecting one from the already loaded products, or by loading new ones</li>
    <il>Setting parameter values; this step is not necessary and if not executed, the default values of the parameters
        will be used.</il>
</ul>

<p>Note: the parameters <i>sourceProduct</i> and <i>sourceProductFile</i> will not be available in the execution form,
    since those are edited by actually selecting the source product(s)!</p>

SNAP is the common software platform for the three Toolboxes which are developed by the European Space Agency (ESA)
for the scientific exploitation of optical and microwave missions.

This is the source code distribution of the SNAP Desktop GUI which is developed on top of
the [SNAP Engine](https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-engine) (snap-engine) and is based on the NetBeans Platform.
For further information read the [readme.md](https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-engine/blob/master/README.md) in the
SNAP Engine project

The project page of SNAP and the toolboxes can be found at http://step.esa.int.
There you will find tutorials about the usage of the application, a forum where you can ask questions and lots
of other interesting things.

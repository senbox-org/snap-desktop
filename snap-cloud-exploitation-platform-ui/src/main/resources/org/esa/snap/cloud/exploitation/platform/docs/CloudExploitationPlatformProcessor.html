<p>
    The Cloud Exploitation Platform Processor is a multi-steps iterative process which processes on the remote machines several products by means of a graph and then create the target product on the host machine using the products created by the remote machines and another graph.
	
    The overall principle of the algorithm is to distribute processing and reduce the execution time when running several products with GPT.
	
</p>
<p>
    The two major steps are:
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (i) execute products according to a graph on the remote machines using the GPT application, which must be installed on the remote machine 
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (ii) use the output products obtained in the previous step together with a another graph to create the final product.

                <b>Current Source Product</b>
                Specify the current source product which will be used to compute the forest cover change. The current source product represents the
                most current product by date.
            </p>
            <p class="i1">
                <b>Previous Source Product</b>
                Specify the previous source product which will be used to compute the forest cover change. The previous source product represents a product that is
                older than the current source product.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b> The two input products must have the same geo-spatial latitude and longitude and the same raster sizes. The two source products must be from
                the same period of the year for a more precise result.

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Save as:</b>
                Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
                combo box presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF, and HDF5.
                The text field allows to specify a target directory. <br>

                <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
                Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
                When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.

                Specify the type to compute the cost between adjacent segments. The merging costs are based on a homogeneity criterion and can represent
                not only how two similar segmentss are but also how homogeneous the resulting larger segment would be.

                step the number of segmentation objects may be reduced by merging the adjacent segments based on the merging cost criterion and
                region merging criterion.

                <b>Recent Date Product Mask and Previous Date Product Mask:</b>
                Specify a raster mask to be added to the target product. If no masks are introduced and the input products are of type sentinel 2, the output product will be influenced by
                scl_dark_feature_shadow, scl_cloud_shadow, scl_water, scl_cloud_low_proba, scl_cloud_medium_proba, scl_cloud_high_proba, scl_thin_cirrus, scl_snow_ice masks from the source products in order

                <b>Degrees of freedom:</b>
               Specifies the degrees of freedom for the chi distribution algorithm. The smaller the value, the more segments are eliminated on the trimming process.

                <b>NOTE:</b> The threshold, spectral weight and shape weight may vary according to the pixel values of the raster. The standard values for spectral weight and for shape weight is 0.5

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The SNAP Level 3 Binning Operator is based on the NASA SeaWiFS binning algorithm as described in:
    <object classid="java:eu.esa.snap.netbeans.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
        <param name="content" value="http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/SeaWiFS/TECH_REPORTS/PreLPDF/PreLVol32.pdf">
        <param name="text" value="<html>&quot;Level 3
    SeaWiFS Data Products: Spatial and Temporal Binning Algorithms&quot; J.W.Campbell,
    J.M. Blasidell, and M.Darzi , NASA Technical Memorandum 104566, Vol.32</html>">
    </object>
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the original algorithm, this implementation gives the user the ability to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select an arbitrary number of aggregation methods, such as arithmetic mean/sigma, min/max, percentile
        threshold.
    </li>
    <li>Programmatically add aggregation methods.</li>
    <li>Predefine a target subset region as minimum/maximum latitude/longitude.</li>
    <li>Define the spatial resolution of the target product.</li>
    <li>Choose a super-sampling in order to avoid Moir&eacute; effects.</li>
    <li>Filter observations based on the <a href="SpatialDataDay.html">spatial data-day</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The term binning refers to the process of distributing the contributions of Level 2
    pixels in satellite coordinates to a fixed Level 3 grid using a geographic reference system.
    A sinusoidal projection is used to realize Level 3 grid comprising a fixed number of equal area bins
    with global coverage.
    This is for example true for the SeaWiFS Level 3 products.
</p>

    See <a href="user_interface.html">here</a> for a description of the user interface as well as the
    parameters that can be used to perform a binning.

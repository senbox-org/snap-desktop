<h3>Spatial Data-Day</h3>
<p>The spatial data-day approach has been introduced in the frame of the GlobColour project. It is used to spatially and
    temporally filter observed pixels during the L3 creation process. This shall avoid mixing pixels with observation
    times that are too far apart.<br>
    This type of filtering increases the duration of a day to include data from the previous and next day. This
    extension
    allows to select pixels with the lowest temporal discrepancy for the same spatial area.<br>
    More detailed information can be found in the

<p>As parametrisation in SNAP the <b><i>minDataHour</i></b> needs to be specified. This value is sensor dependent.
    In the GlobColour PUG this value is named the crossing nodal time (CNT). This CNT value is equal to the equator
    crossing time (ECT) which is more commonly used.
</p>

<p>Values for some sensors are provided in the table below. For other sensors the ECT value can be looked up from
    the sensor specification pages.

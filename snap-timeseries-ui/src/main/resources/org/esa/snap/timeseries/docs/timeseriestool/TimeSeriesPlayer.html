    The Time Series Player is the main visualisation tool for the time dimension introduced by the Time Series Tool. It is
    opened by clicking on <img src="../images/timeseries-player24.png" alt="ts-player-button"> and displayed in
    Screenshot 1.
</p>

<p>
    The Time Series Player allows vividly visualising a time series by providing the control elements for navigating
    through a time series, either manually or automatically. The slider may be dragged, or automatic playback of the
    Time Series is started by clicking on <img src="../images/play.png" alt="play">, paused by clicking on
    <img src="../images/pause.png" alt="pause"> (visible only when playback is performed), and stopped by clicking on
    <img src="../images/stop.png" alt="stop">. The playback automatically re-starts from the beginning if
    <img src="../images/repeat.png" alt="repeat"> is selected. With the blending feature enabled (by clicking on
    <img src="../images/blend.png" alt="blend">), the transitions from one image to the next are smoothed. The playback-
    speed may be specified by using the small slider next to the blending-button.
</p>

<p>
    For further analysis of the Time Series, it may be exported as an animated GIF using
    <img src="../images/export.gif" alt="export">. Before the export is started, the resolution level to export may be
    specified; level 0 means that all data are exported, while higher levels mean higher degrees of interpolation (and,
    thus, smaller resulting GIFs).

<p>A helpful tool within the Time Series Tool is the Time Series Matrix, shown in
    Screenshot 1. It is opened by clicking on <img src="../images/timeseries-matrix24.png" alt="ts-matrix-button">.

<p>
    The matrix toolview acts like a magnifying glass: the user can show the pixel value of the pixel the mouse is
    currently over, together with its neighbouring pixel values. The matrix's size may be specified, while at least
    3x3 pixels are shown.
    This tool also has a temporal dimension: when holding the <i>Alt</i>-key and scrolling the mouse-wheel, it is
    'scrolled through time', meaning that the values from the other dates of the time series are being shown.
